      "content": "J. K. Rowlings Harry Potter series has gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide, and first editions of her books have very quickly become collectable. By far the most valuable book in the series is the first, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, published on 30 June 1997 by Bloomsbury in London. But to have any real collectable value, it has to be a copy of the first edition, first impression (also known as the first printing). This means the very first batch of books off the press, of which there were only a few thousand.  Reprints of Philosophers Stone (and even first editions of the later books in the series) have much lower values, in part because so many more of them were printed."

      "content": "The Navi return to the big screen this weekend Disneylooks to reignite interest in its newly acquired Avatar franchise, three months before the debut of the long-delayed sequel, Avatar The Way of Water. Bringing the highest-grossing film of all time back to theaters has two purposes for Disney: drum up excitement for “The Way of Water” and fill a vacant spot on the theatrical calendar. The sequel is one of four due over the next decade."
